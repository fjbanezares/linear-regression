* We can see it uses Pandas to combine salaries data with happiness data
* As it comes from two different datasets we merge the information
* Then we use this data to generate a Linear regression Model
* Then we see how the result would be using k-NN with k=3, meaning we average the happiness from the 2 closest in salary countries
* We could make the linear model complex with more attributes or use polynomial regression model
